## Compiler

I use Mingw-w64 and the MSYS2 subsystem. To me this is the simplest to setup and maintain. In the end I can still build and run from a powershell or cmd shell, And it just works.

## Build system

I use CMAKE and Ninja. CMAKE is a cross platform replacement for the linux configure script style build. It creates the make/configure files for most build tools including, gnu make, Visual Studio, CodeBlocks, Ninja and many more. I use Ninja which is a fast replacement for make.

## Source code revision control and management

I like most everyone else now days use git. It has man nice features. I install it using the package liked below and use the default/recommended choices.
